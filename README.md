My projects range from auditing tools and attack frameworks to practical applications that enhance cybersecurity and simplify complex tasks. I work on them mostly because I enjoy it. Most of my projects are still in development, and I usually share them when they are almost finished. However, some are not yet complete and have many features to be added. Even if a repository hasn't been updated for weeks or months, I plan to continue improving them whenever I find the time.
